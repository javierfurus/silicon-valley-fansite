            >"We are in the seat of the US government, a government that was
            founded by people who were, at one point, ruled by kings they
            couldn't overthrow. So, what did they do, right? They started over.
            They came here, to the New World. World 2.0, version 1776. And the
            way we win is by creating a new, democratic, decentralized Internet,
            one where the behavior of companies like this will be impossible,
            forever. One where it is the users, not the kings, who have
            sovereign control over their data. This, I promise to you: I will
            help you end this tyranny by building an Internet that is of the
            people, by the people, and for the people, so help me God."</i

              <p class="content-text">
                Richard invented and built the start-up Pied Piper, a program
                designed to find music matches, while living at Erlich’s Hacker
                Hostel alongside his best friend Big Head and fellow geeks
                Dinesh and Gilfoyle. Pied Piper’s compression algorithm
                triggered a bidding war and ultimately garnered funding from
                Peter Gregory's company Raviga. After winning TechCrunch Disrupt
                -- and $50,000 -- Richard and Pied Piper are in the spotlight
                more than ever, which for Richard means non-stop thrills (read:
                nausea and debilitating panic).

              <p class="content-name">System Architect</p>
              <p class="content-text">
                Gilfoyle lived and worked at the Hacker Hostel with Richard, Big
                Head, and Dinesh. He is pompous and purports to be good at
                system architecture, networking, and security. Gilfoyle often
                finds himself sparring with Dinesh about things such as their
                work efficiency, Dinesh's Pakistani ethnicity, Gilfoyle's
                religion along with other negligible matters. Often Gilfoyle
                triumphs in these arguments or reaches an impasse with Dinesh.
                He is a self-described LaVeyan Satanist, and bears an
                upside-down cross tattoo on his right arm. His persona is an
                apathetic badass programmer that has libertarian tendencies. To
                say he is odd is an understatement.

                Dinesh lives and works in the Hacker Hostel with Richard, Big
                Head, and Gilfoyle. He possesses a dry wit and skills at writing
                code, particularly Java. Dinesh often finds himself sparring
                with Gilfoyle. He is originally from Pakistan but is a US
                citizen, unlike Gilfoyle. He claims it took him five years to
                get US citizenship and was asked about Al-Qaeda "like 14 times."

              <p class="content-text">
                Donald "Jared" Dunn was a Hooli executive and right-hand man to
                the head of the company, Gavin Belson, but after gaining a
                particular interest in Richard’s algorithm, quit his job at
                Hooli to work for Pied Piper. Jared was raised by a series of
                foster parents, but despite this rocky early life went on to
                study at Vassar College, earning a B. A. in Economics. Although
                his real first name is Donald, Gavin Belson started calling him
                'Jared' on his first day at Hooli, and the name stuck.

              <p class="content-text">
                Monica joined Raviga in 2010, worked her way up quickly under
                Peter’s tutelage, and is now the youngest Associate Partner in
                Raviga’s history. Previously, she had been an analyst at
                McKinsey and Co., and before that did opposition research for
                the 2008 Obama campaign. Monica focuses on software startups.
                She also is passionate about both the consumer and healthcare
                sectors and has written several scholarly articles regarding
                consumer and patient rights. Monica earned her Bachelor of
                Science in economics from Princeton University and her MBA from
                the Stanford School of Business. Before Peter Gregory's death,
                Monica was Raviga’s head of operations, handling the day-to-day
                duties of his tech investment business and often fielding
                pitches and working directly with tech folks using Peter’s
                money. Now she works under Laurie Bream as an associate partner.
                Monica took a particular interest in Pied Piper's algorithm from
                the beginning and has taken Peter's board seat at Richard's
                request.

                clings to his glory days, when he sold aviation start-up Aviato,
                a move that, at least in his mind, qualifies him to be a
                svengali lording over other tech nerds. He still drives a car
                emblazoned with multiple Aviato logos and smokes copious amounts
                of weed.
